# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

In this project we will apply flex-box and grid layout to develop a landing page for a web application which enables the users to add photographs to their profile. In this phase we will confine the development to front-end only. Eventually we will develop a full fledged website with backend functionality.

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
