# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

In this project we will apply flex-box and grid layout to develop a landing page for a web application which enables the users to store and display images they own. In this phase we will confine the development to front-end based on HTML and CSS only. Eventually we will develop a full fledged website with backend functionality.

- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

In this project I used HTML and CSS to create the landing page. I used BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology to create the page. Flexbox and media queries are used to make the page content sensitive to screen sizes. Figma was used to design the page layout.

**Images**

The images were exported directly from Figma, and the image sizes were optimized using [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/). This will help the page to load faster
